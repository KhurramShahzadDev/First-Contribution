Hello I am Khurram Shahzad, Learning Web development and Would like to share something.
If you're new to web development and want to practice building websites on your own computer, you can create a localhost. So, Here I would like to share with you:
1-Go to the Start menu in Windows and search for Control Panel.
2-In the search panel, select the "Programs and Features" option.
3-Select the option "Turn Windows features on or off."
4-Select "Internet Information Services" and click OK.
5-Go to your browser and search for "localhost."
6-You will see the Internet Information Services page, and localhost should be up.
7-Go to Local Disk(C:) and check for the "inetpub" folder, then go to "wwwroot."
8-Paste a random picture in the "wwwroot" folder and search for "localhost/Picname" in your browser.
9-You should see the picture there, the same one you pasted in the "wwwroot" folder.
10-Make a backup folder in "wwwroot" and paste all of the files in "wwwroot" there. Then, copy your project file and paste it in "wwwroot."
11-That's it! Your project is now ready for use in localhost.
Happy Journey!
